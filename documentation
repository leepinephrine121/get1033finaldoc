Project: Happy Hardcore Video Search website
How it works + What does it do?:
 > 3 different search boxes to type in what you want to search: Song Title, Artist & Album 
 > Simple search engine mechanics used

Reason for making it:
 > Happy Hardcore music is a genre many neglect or have not heard about. This website aims to
 promote such music to the world and show that classical is not always the trend everytime.

Journal Catalog:
Week 9: Planning to join Jun Bang’s group. Details were still volatile

Week 10: Decided to put Jun Bang’s group as backup. Managed to join Darius’ group.
Plan: To create a mobile app for scooters that tracks speed of scooter and gives warnings
and even fines for speeding offences.

Week 11:
•	Darius puts down group project, me back to solo again.
•	Desperately looking through Final Project Excel Sheet to find solo person to partner with
•	Tried Li Li’s group for tracking expenditure, doesn’t work out.

Week 12:
•	Jun Bang’s group also not possible due to complexity of project.
•	Given up on life. So tired with eye infection affecting mood.
•	Decided to give up on team and do solo

Week 13:
14/11/18:
•	Initial idea: Search Engine for Happy Hardcore music
•	10:30 am - 12 pm
  > Went to Dennis to get started. (Had nothing to start with)
  > Downloaded Sublime Text Portable
	> Quick review of files and coding in html + other media (java, css etc.)
  > Made text appear on screen to represent different sections to search by (song, artist, album)
	> Made personal logo to be displayed above search bars, which were also created. 
  
•	1 pm - 3 pm
 > Created search engines in the website
 > Modificaations to allow refresh of results list, widening of columns and shifting of
 text to make the list look neater
 > Inputted links in songs to send user to YouTube video with song
 > Initial Product done! Now for minor modifications/touch-ups.

• 3 pm - 4 pm
 > Progressively adding more songs to the list
 > Added title "Happy Hardcore Search" in big font.
 Tried for an anagram but failed.
 > Thought of alphabetical sorting of results list.
 Sorted elements  in database instead to compensate. (Priority list: Artist, Album, Song
 Reasoning:
 --> Searching by artist: Album sorting makes it easier to look for song.
 --> Searching by album: Artist order will make is easy to look for song.
 --> Searching by song: Negligible due to limited songs with similar word structure.
 Overall reasoning: Most albums have only one song for each featured artist
 > Squeezed main text with logo together to maximize space at top of browser

• 4 pm - 6 pm
 > Continuing adding songs to the list
 > Finished adding J-neration 1 playlist
 > Started on Documentation writing for other segments
