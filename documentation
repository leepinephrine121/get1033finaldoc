Project: Happy Hardcore Video Search website
How it works + What does it do?:
 > 3 different search boxes to type in what you want to search: Song Title, Artist & Album 
 > Simple search engine mechanics used

Reason for making it:
 > Happy Hardcore music is a genre many neglect or have not heard about. This website aims to
 promote such music to the world and show that classical is not always the trend everytime.

Journal Catalog:
Week 9: Planning to join Jun Bang’s group. Details were still volatile

Week 10: Decided to put Jun Bang’s group as backup. Managed to join Darius’ group.
Plan: To create a mobile app for scooters that tracks speed of scooter and gives warnings
and even fines for speeding offences.

Week 11:
•	Darius puts down group project, me back to solo again.
•	Desperately looking through Final Project Excel Sheet to find solo person to partner with
•	Tried Li Li’s group for tracking expenditure, doesn’t work out.

Week 12:
•	Jun Bang’s group also not possible due to complexity of project.
•	Given up on life. So tired with eye infection affecting mood.
•	Decided to give up on team and do solo

Week 13:
14/11/18:
•	Initial idea: Search Engine for Happy Hardcore music
•	10:30 am - 12 pm
  > Went to Dennis to get started. (Had nothing to start with)
  > Downloaded Sublime Text Portable
	> Quick review of files and coding in html + other media (java, css etc.)
  > Made text appear on screen to represent different sections to search by (song, artist, album)
	> Made personal logo to be displayed above search bars, which were also created. 
  
• 1 pm - 3 pm
 > Created search engines in the website
 > Modificaations to allow refresh of results list, widening of columns and shifting of
 text to make the list look neater
 > Inputted links in songs to send user to YouTube video with song
 > Initial Product done! Now for minor modifications/touch-ups.

• 3 pm - 4 pm
 > Progressively adding more songs to the list
 > Added title "Happy Hardcore Search" in big font.
 Tried for an anagram but failed.
 > Thought of alphabetical sorting of results list.
 Sorted elements  in database instead to compensate. (Priority list: Artist, Album, Song
 Reasoning:
 --> Searching by artist: Album sorting makes it easier to look for song.
 --> Searching by album: Artist order will make is easy to look for song.
 --> Searching by song: Negligible due to limited songs with similar word structure.
 Overall reasoning: Most albums have only one song for each featured artist
 > Squeezed main text with logo together to maximize space at top of browser

• 4 pm - 6 pm
 > Continuing adding songs to the list
 > Finished adding J-neration 1 playlist
 > Started on Documentation writing for other segments

15/11/18:
• 2 pm - 4 pm
 > Finished adding J-neration 2-5 playlists
 > Attempt to implement font that supports Chinese characters ended in failure

16/11/18:
• 8 am - 2 pm
 > Finished adding all J-neration playlists
 > Added Creative Commons copyright sign onto project
 > Finished!
 
Improvements/Features of Future versions:
 > Change of font to allow Chinese characters to be seen
 > For Albums & Artists, drop-down menus included
 > More albums added to database, including those from countries other than Japan
 > 3 search options that contain links that change what the 1 search box will be searching
 > Box outlines for the results list
 > Links above logo that take user to Jozu Music, a Happy Hardcore-centric Youtube channel.

Critical Analysis:
 > The project is simple, but it excels in its simplicity.
 > The search bar system could be neater with the many search options clumped so close together.
 > Same story goes for the results list with the different soundtrack links also so close together.
 > Results list is well-sorted but could be better in terms of making it neat due to no
 sense of borders in the table.
 > Any chinese character is unrecognised and looks messy on the results list.
 
COnnection to ideas learned:
 > Implementation of Copyright showcases my rights to my own digital creation. (Digital Rights Management)
 > Usage of github to present project (Week 11 Tutorial)
 > Learning about making a search engine (Week 9 Tutorial Workshop)
 
Affordances:
 > Spatial: Search space is limited to 11 different songlists. Low
 > Encyclopedic: Search engine looks through vast number of soundtracks created
 by a vast number of artists. High
 > Participlatory: Just search and find. Not much else to do. Low
 > Procedural: Search, find and listen. Not much else. Medium
 
Usage of new abilities of computers:
 > Usage of several programming language (html, css, js) to create the website
 > Usage of developer tools in Chrome to make it easier to amend the code
 > Use of coding software (Sublime Text) that makes coding simpler and quicker
 
Projects that this project builds on:
 > Jozu Music: Also an encyclopedic engine that is filled with Happy Hardcore music
 > Other YT channels that have uploaded such music
 > All search engines in terms of the idea behind my own project
 > Plain design choice similar to J-neration official website.
